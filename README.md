# Extra Block Recipe

## Overview
The **Extra Block** recipe (`morethanthemes/extra_block`) provides a collection of reusable **Text/HTML blocks** in Drupal. These blocks are placed in predefined regions (such as the footer) and are ideal for **demonstration purposes** or as starting points for site composition.
